Algorithm to see who could know who 

Since I provide the make file, You can compile and run it like last time 
Make sure that you have a.txt in the same directory when you compile. 
make

./matrix a.txt


When you compile,I make it so you can read the recommendar info 
a.txt is my matrix A 
And the resulting matrix is saved in result.txt
So please also read that thanks. 



How to compile? 
step 1: make
step 2: ./adjacency
Step3:ls 
Step4:you see the rec.txt file
